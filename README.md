# Overcast for Mac (unofficial)

Unofficial Overcast for Mac is simply the Overcast website wrapped within
**Electron**, restyled so it feels a bit more native to the desktop.

Some interface elements are disabled on purpose because they serve little
purpose to me, mostly because I use Overcast for iOS for most management and listening, and prefer the mac app to be a nice looking read-only (for now).

### Potential Issues

Since it's just a restyled websites, it's prone to potential issues if [Marco](https://twitter.com/marcoarment)
