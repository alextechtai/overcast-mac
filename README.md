# Overcast for Mac (unofficial)

Unofficial Overcast for Mac is simply the Overcast website wrapped within
Electron.app, restyled so it feels a bit more native to the desktop.

Some interface elements are disabled on purpose because they serve little
purpose for me, mostly because I use Overcast for iOS for most management and listening, and prefer the mac app to be a nice looking read-only (for now).
